# Course-Projects
This repo includes some interesting open questions or projects I came across during SJTU courses 
## CS359 Computer System Architecture
### Critique of Dynamic branch prediction with perceptrons
A small critique about a classic paper. [link](https://github.com/daxixi/Course-Projects/blob/main/Critique%20of%20Dynamic%20branch%20prediction%20with%20perceptrons.pdf)
## CS240 Computer Ethnics
### Computer Ethnics and Cyperpunk
An intersting discussion between computer ethnics and cyperpunk2077. In chinese edition. [link](https://github.com/daxixi/Course-Projects/blob/main/Computer%20Ethnics%20and%20Cyperpunk.pdf)
## MA500 Application of fuzzy Math
An interesting math project. Sometimes people would like to buy assemble computers, but feel difficult to find best solution. We use the method of fuzzy math and evaluate the performance of different computer hardware. The we give out a solution to how to choose the most economic and the most efficient composition of computer hardwares.  In chinese edition.[link](https://github.com/daxixi/Course-Projects/blob/main/Assembly%20machine%20evaluation.pdf)
## MA119 Probability and Stastics
Another interesting math project. In this math project, I use the method of theory of probability and stastics to evalute the correlation between people with cardiovascular disease and their BMI index. I established the distribution of BMI index and give out a prediction of probability of having such diseases.  In chinese edition.

## BM033 An introduction to Public Health and Preventive Medicine
A case study and research of relationship between AI and Nutriology. Since I major in CS and AI, I do some researches about how CS and AI can contribute to the public health and nutriology. I gave my understanding of Intelligent Nutriology. In chinese edition [link](https://github.com/daxixi/Course-Projects/blob/main/Intelligent%20Nutriology.pdf)
