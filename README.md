## Critique of Dynamic branch prediction with perceptrons
A short critique. [link](https://github.com/daxixi/Course-Projects/blob/main/Critique%20of%20Dynamic%20branch%20prediction%20with%20perceptrons.pdf)
## ASD Saliency Map Prediction and Discrimination Based on SalGAN
We leverage the method of SalGan to generate a saliency map of ASD children. With our method, doctors can better discriminate and find those children with ASD. [link](https://github.com/daxixi/Course-Projects/blob/main/ASD%20Saliency%20Map%20Prediction%20and%20Discrimination.pdf).
