# Course-Projects
This repo includes some interesting open questions or projects I came across during SJTU and UofT courses. 

# SJTU
## CS359 Computer System Architecture
### Critique of Dynamic branch prediction with perceptrons
A small critique about a classic paper. [link](https://github.com/daxixi/Course-Projects/blob/main/Critique%20of%20Dynamic%20branch%20prediction%20with%20perceptrons.pdf)
## CS240 Computer Ethnics
### Computer Ethnics and Cyperpunk
An interesting discussion between computer ethnics and cyperpunk2077. In chinese edition. [link](https://github.com/daxixi/Course-Projects/blob/main/Computer%20Ethnics%20and%20Cyperpunk.pdf)
## CS386 Digital Graphics Processing
### Multi-Channel Joint Model for Smartphone Camera Photo IQA Based on Residual Network
We design a novel structure for neural networks. The networks can better evaluate the quality of smartphone camera images. Due to the problem of copyright. It cannot be released currently.
### ASD Saliency Map Prediction and Discrimination Based on SalGAN
A very interesting project. We use the method of SalGan to solve an interesting problem. We improved the method of SalGAN and used it to generate a saliency map of ASD children. As a result, with our method, doctors can better discriminate and find those children with ASD. [link](https://github.com/daxixi/Course-Projects/blob/main/ASD%20Saliency%20Map%20Prediction%20and%20Discrimination.pdf). Follow my collaborators opinions, I will not release the source code yet.
## MA500 Application of fuzzy Math
An interesting math project. Sometimes people would like to buy assembled computers, but feel difficult to find the best solution. We use the method of fuzzy math and evaluate the performance of different computer hardware. The we give out a solution to how to choose the most economic and the most efficient composition of computer hardware.  In chinese edition.[link](https://github.com/daxixi/Course-Projects/blob/main/Assembly%20machine%20evaluation.pdf)
## MA119 Probability and Statistics
Another interesting math project. In this math project, I use the method of the theory of probability and statics to estimate the correlation between people with cardiovascular disease and their BMI index. I established the distribution of BMI index and give out a prediction of probability of having such diseases.  In chinese edition. [link](https://github.com/daxixi/Course-Projects/blob/main/Study%20of%20%20distribution%20of%20cardiovascular%20disease%20patients'%20BMI.pdf) 
## BM033 An introduction to Public Health and Preventive Medicine
A case study and research of relationship between AI and Nutriology. Since I major in CS and AI, I do some research about how CS and AI can contribute to public health and nutri ology. I gave my understanding of Intelligent Nutriology. In chinese edition [link](https://github.com/daxixi/Course-Projects/blob/main/Intelligent%20Nutriology.pdf)
