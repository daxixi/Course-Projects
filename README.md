# Course-Projects
This repo includes some interesting open questions or projects I came across during SJTU and UofT courses. 

# SJTU
## CS359 Computer System Architecture
### Critique of Dynamic branch prediction with perceptrons
A small critique about a classic paper. [link](https://github.com/daxixi/Course-Projects/blob/main/Critique%20of%20Dynamic%20branch%20prediction%20with%20perceptrons.pdf)
## CS386 Digital Graphics Processing
### Multi-Channel Joint Model for Smartphone Camera Photo IQA Based on Residual Network
We design a novel structure for neural networks. The networks can better evaluate the quality of smartphone camera images. Due to the problem of copyright. It cannot be released currently.
### ASD Saliency Map Prediction and Discrimination Based on SalGAN
A very interesting project. We use the method of SalGan to solve an interesting problem. We improved the method of SalGAN and used it to generate a saliency map of ASD children. As a result, with our method, doctors can better discriminate and find those children with ASD. [link](https://github.com/daxixi/Course-Projects/blob/main/ASD%20Saliency%20Map%20Prediction%20and%20Discrimination.pdf). Follow my collaborators opinions, I will not release the source code yet.
